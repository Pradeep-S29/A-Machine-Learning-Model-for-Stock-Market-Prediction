A machine learning model for stock market prediction involves collecting historical stock data and relevant features, such as technical indicators and news sentiment.
After preprocessing and feature engineering, various algorithms (like regression, decision trees, or neural networks) are trained on the data.
The model is then evaluated for accuracy and deployed in a trading environment. 
Continuous monitoring and updates are essential to adapt to changing market conditions.
